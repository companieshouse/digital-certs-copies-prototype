        <p class="govuk-body">A paper certificate will include the company name, company number and incorporation date. You can choose to add more information about the company, for example a statement of good standing.  </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Digital certificates will be a PDF document, embedded with an approved Registrar of Companies electronic signature.

        <p class="govuk-body">For now, digital certificates will include set company information and cannot be customised. They will not include a statement of good standing. If you need this, you should order a paper certificate instead.</p>
